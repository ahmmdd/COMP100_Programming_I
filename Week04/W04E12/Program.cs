 * 12.	In the game Rock Paper Scissors, two players simultaneously choose 
 * one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. If both players choose 
 * the same option, then the result is a tie. However, if they choose 
 * differently, the winner is determined as follows:
 * 
 * --> Rock beats scissors, because a rock can break a pair of scissors.
 * --> Scissors beats paper, because scissors can cut paper.
 * --> Paper beats rock, because a piece of paper can cover a rock.
