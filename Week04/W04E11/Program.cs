 * 11.	
 * You can create a random number that is at least min but less than max using 
 * the following statements:
 * 
 *          Random ranNumberGenerator = new Random();
 *          int randomNumber;
 *          randomNumber = ranNumberGenerator.Next(min, max);
 *          
 * Write a console-based program that generates a random number between 1 and 
 * 10. (In other words, min is 1 and max is 11.) Ask a user to guess the 
 * random number, then display the random number and a message indicating 
 * whether the user’s guess was too high, too low, or correct.
