/*
 * 14.	
 * Create a console-based lottery game application. Generate three random numbers,
 * each between 1 and 4. Allow the user to guess three numbers. Compare each of the 
 * user’s guesses to the three random numbers and display a message that includes the 
 * user’s guess, the randomly determined three-digit number, and the amount of money 
 * the user has won as follows:
 * 
 * Matching Numbers	--------------------->   Award ($)
 * Any one matching	--------------------->        10
 * Two matching	------------------------->       100
 * Three matching, not in order	--------->     1,000
 * Three matching in exact order -------->    10,000
 * No matches --------------------------->         0
 * 
 * Make certain that your application accommodates repeating digits. For example, if 
 * a user guesses 1, 2, and 3, and the randomly generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do 
 * not give the user credit for three correct guesses—just one.
